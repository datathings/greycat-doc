# Task Action: propertiesNames
The `propertiesNames` action allows to get all the property names of node(s) in the result.
This action should only be used after a task returning node(s) as result.

The next result will be a array of all the properties names.

If you want to get specific type, you can use [propertiesNamesWithTypes](propertiesNamesWithTypes.md)
